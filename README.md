# Interactive Weather Forecast

## Description
This project was made to learn about using third party APIs to call for and use data. I learned the workflow of using a third party API, as well as what an API response will commonly look like.

## Usage
Go to the deployed application where you will be presented with a search bar. Search for a city by name and the current weather will populate into the upper box. The 5 day forecast will appear below the current weather and your search will be saved in storage. If you click on a history item, the weather for your selection will appear.
